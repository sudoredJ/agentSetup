# arXiv Integration for Grok Agent

## Overview
Added arXiv paper search and retrieval capabilities to the existing Grok research agent.

## Implementation

### 1. arXiv Tools (`src/tools/arxiv_tools.py`)
Created simple HTTP-based tools that directly use the arXiv API:
- `search_arxiv_papers()` - Search papers by query, title, author, abstract
- `get_arxiv_details()` - Get detailed info about a specific paper
- `download_arxiv_paper()` - Download paper as PDF to user's Downloads folder
- `load_arxiv_to_context()` - Load paper metadata and abstract for analysis
- `get_arxiv_url()` - Get direct PDF and abstract URLs

### 2. Grok Agent Updates
- Added arXiv tools to Grok's tool list in `grok_agent.yaml`
- Updated system prompt to mention arXiv capabilities
- Updated evaluation logic to recognize arXiv requests (94% confidence)

## Example Requests
- "Search for papers by Yann LeCun on convolutional neural networks"
- "Get details about the Attention is All You Need paper"
- "Download the BERT paper from arXiv"
- "Find recent papers about transformer architectures"

## Notes
- No additional Slack tokens needed - uses existing Grok agent
- Downloads go to `~/Downloads/arxiv_papers/`
- Clean implementation without MCP server complexity
- Integrated into multi-agent coordination system
